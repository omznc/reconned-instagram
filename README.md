This is a proof of concept on getting instagram account data via an api endpoint.

Currently, the only way to do so is to use their funky oauth and tokens (which expire in 60 days and the user needs to reauthorize). This sucks for obvious reasons.
On reconned.com, I'd love to have a feature where both clubs and people can add their instagram accounts and display photos.

For clubs, this feature is finished using Meta's business APIs, but that requires the club account to be a business account connected with a facebook account.
It's a process, but it works fine, and the tokens don't expire. Check it out on my club https://reconned.com/c/veis

I'd love to be able to do this for users, but I can't expect club pages to register as Meta business pages, let alone individuals, so I'm exploring other options.
